# PenangJS Talks

If you'd like to give a talk to our motley crew of JavaScript developers / users / lovers / newbies / explorers, we'd love to hear your proposal!

We're using GitHub Issues for talk submissions. This way people can ask questions, give feedback and +1 their favourites. If your talk isn't scheduled for the next meetup, leave the issue open and we may invite you to give it in the future (based on theme or time constraints)

After each meetup, we (or the speaker) will update issues with slides, links, and other useful information.

## Things to think about

Have a read through [this slide deck](http://www.slideshare.net/LookAtMySlides/codeware). It's a very good overview of how to design a good slidedeck for a technical presentation.

### Slides

Our current venue use a projector that are quite a bit smaller. Because of this:

* Use very large fonts and less text per screen so your slide is legible at the back of the room

* If you have code examples, we suggest you make them take up the entire screen with as large a font as possible

* Minimise the use of code examples and bullet points as they will be hard to read

* If you want to demo something, consider using a screen capture movie or gif. [licecap](http://www.cockos.com/licecap) is a tool that can help with this.

### Speaking

We use a hand-held mike rather than a lapel or headset so practice presenting with one hand [holding a mike](http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.1523784.1384980457!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/article_970/hug.jpg).

Think about where you need your laptop positioned for advancing slides based on where you like to stand while speaking (at the front of the room, or off to the side).

Every 3rd Wednesday of the month you'll find us talking about what we're doing and what's happening around us in the world of JavaScript.
